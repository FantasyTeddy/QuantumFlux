Source code and bug tacker.  More information can be found on the official forum topic

### About

QuantumFlux is a Forge mod for Minecraft that focuses on adding ways to generate, store, and transport RF power without adding anything to the world generation.

### Modpack Distribution
Sure, please link back to here though. A link to [my patreon](http://www.patreon.com/jotato) would be appriciated. Just don't be a jerk, make claims you can't back, or sell mod items on your server.
