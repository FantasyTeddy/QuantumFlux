## QuantumFlux for Minecraft 1.7.10

Source code and bug tacker.  More information can be found on the official forum topic

### About

QuantumFlux is a Forge mod for Minecraft that focuses on adding ways to generate, store, and transport RF power without adding anything to the world generation.

### Modpacks 
*:Begin Rant:*  
I *still* don't understand why people care about this, and I feel like the community as a whole needs to get over themselves. Do people really want that tenth of a cent from adfly (don't even get me started there...) Perhaps they are afraid of someone else taking credit? Well, a dis-honerable person isn't going to honor you modpack license anyway. Don't be a douche, let people include your mod in their pack.   
*:End Rant:*

All that to say, don't ask me. Just include the mod in your pack and don't be stupid about it.
