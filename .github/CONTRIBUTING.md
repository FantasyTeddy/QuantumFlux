Thanks for helping out, I really appriciate it. I have been writing code for too long to realy care about standards. I'm more of a "just don't be dumb" kind of a guy. All I really as is:

1. If I ask you to change something or deny a request, don't take is personal. It is most likely becuase I have different plans already. Your best bet would be to open an issue and talk about the change you want to make first.
2. Don't change the formatting just because you like something better. It makes diffs harder to read when every line is changed
3. Keep PRs small and to a single change. It isn't hard to add an additional one. If you really don't want to make PR for a "1 line change" leave a comment or make an issue and I will do it.
